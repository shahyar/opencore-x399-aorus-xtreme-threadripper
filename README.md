# OpenCore Gigabyte X399 Aorus Xtreme config
Tested on F3 BIOS. There's a config.plist for standard booting, in which everything works.

An alternate config for Proxmox (QEMU) is also provided, in which everything except audio works. I was never able to figure out how to get it to work, as the discovered HDEF device does not seem to map to the ALC1220.
